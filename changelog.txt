Changes in version 2.0 (2015/01/27)
--------------------------------------
* AppSensor has gone through a complete re-write, 
  and the current feature set is listed below.
  
* Client-server architecture supporting multiple 
  execution "modes" including: 
	- REST 
	- SOAP
	- Thrift
	- local (shared JVM, java-only)
  
* Any language can be used on the client application. 
  The only requirement is that the language selected 
  must support the communication protocol of the execution
  mode that is configured (ie. if using REST as the 
  execution mode, the language must be capable of making 
  HTTP requests.) 
  The server-side components are Java, but this places
  no restriction on the client applications themselves.

* There is no longer a dependency on ESAPI. AppSensor
  is a standalone project, though it can be used to 
  integrate with projects that also use ESAPI if 
  desired.
  
* The major subsystems are all modular and extensible, 
  including: 
  	- access control
  	- analysis engine
  	- configuration
  	- reporting
  	- storage

* While extensible, all major subsystems have at least
  one reference implementation.

* The core components of the system have been renamed 
  and now follow the appsensor v2 book naming conventions, 
  which is based on standard IDS terminology for clarity.

* Basic user correlation is supported so that client 
  applications that share a user base can share attack information.
  
* A website for the project has been built (appsensor.org).
